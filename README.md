# About Me :otter:	

Hi!! I'm Rei (he/him), a UAF Art/CS student, NTS student employee, prospective tattoo artist, and (if you can't tell) a massive fan of otters. <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/w1VNliQ.png" width="300">

I do: 
- Draw stuff
- Make stuff (of various mediums)

I want to: 
- Make games
- Code more (currently learning C++)
- Tattoo People

If you're interested in any of my artsy things, you can check out my [carrd](https://xxrei.carrd.co) for all my socials! 

For gamey and codey things, you're in the right place! It's an empty shell of an account for now, but should maybe have some content in the future!
